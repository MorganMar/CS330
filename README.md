How do I approach designing software?
When it comes to designing software I first look over what the end goal of the assignment is and what is everything that is expected to be a part of the project. This way I can plan out every part needed and I can map out what steps are needed in order to get the project 
done within its time limit. For this specific project it was already broken down into the steps so I was able to look over the tutorials given and on youtube in order to work through each step. In terms of process I looked over the guidlines given for each assignment to 
see what was needed and for the design portions of the final I got the photo I wanted and started to think of how I wanted to texture the items and present them when designing. I think the main tactic I can use for future work is working with the paint app in order to help
get the RGB color values to input to add color into the app. This made it easy in the earlier assignments before texturing was introduced in order to help convey colors. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I take it step by step when developing programs, in the case of this project it was done in theme with the milestones provided by the class. This allowed me to start learning the process of graphic design as I am very new to it and be able to submit the assignments in and
work towards submitting the completed final. I think the main strategy I found was once I learned the different factors that go into graphic design such as utilizing color or textures and lighting in order to enhance the scene and build it out. In the case of this project
I chose to focus on the textures in order to enhance the imagery and help showcase the items. I also brought in color theory to help with the scene. One of the main changes I did was change the laptops color to black in order to contrast the foggy glass table and then I
changed the candle container to a stain glass purple because I felt that worked better with the colors and helped enhanse the candle. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
computer science in the context of this class is very helpful for future classes as I now have basic skills with graphic design that I can utilize in future graphic classes in order to help produce something more advance and in terms of a professional pathway I am still
thinking of going into video game design and this was a good look into how games are designed and the process that goes into creating individial aspects that all flow together for one image. This helped give me insight and has revived my interest in going the graphic
design route.
